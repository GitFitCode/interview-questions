Question Discussion Guide:

General: 
- use "npm run test" to see results 
  - (still undecided if this should only be done once, or at end of each hour session.)
- Emphasize the "Testing Code (don't change)" comments and overall 19 questions layout before starting
- I think Question 19 is the best of the hardest, finishing questions because it addresses recursion and navigating an object.
  - Try to at least get to that, even if it means skipping 18 and/or others.


Questions:
2. 
  - Expect student to use "hoisting" in their answer. 
  - Discuss whether "const" and "let" would work too
    - "let" is the harder to answer one, bc it will throw a "ReferenceError," instead of "undefined"
    - Can also question function scoping (var) vs block level scoping (let).

3. Make sure to check for off-by-one errors since the auto tests won't catch that!

5. Constructor Function can be two answers:
  - A stand-alone function that uses the "this" keyword to generate a new object when called w/ "new"
  - Or the constructor as part of a class 

6. Best answers would mention the difference between "pass by reference" and "pass by value," or similar.

8. 
  - Feel free to help student with inputs for "split" method if they are new to it (should be empty string as token).
  - Most concise answer would use "split," "reverse," and "join".

9. Can discuss, or try to elicit, the reason that functional programming works in JS is because functions are objects. 

10. 
  - Probably the most confusing question, so be ready to explain the example code.
  - NOTE: Make sure student skips over the automated testing code right after the above example code and continues to their answer area.

11. 
  - Best answers will mention "instance variables" (variables for each called function) vs "static variables" (variables for the class/function as a whole).
  - Although this is not a huge JS concept.

12. Feel free to help student with "switch" syntax because the next two questions rely on it.

13./14. 
  - The requirement that each entry in the lookup table be a function may not be immediately obvious.
  - Good test for stress and/or close-reading of instructions 

15. "Filter Out" terminology is usually confusing here. Guide if needed.

16. Will have to use "this" to complete. Good time for prototype discussion.
